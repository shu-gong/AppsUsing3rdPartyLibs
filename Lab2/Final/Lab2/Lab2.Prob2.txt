Problem 2: OpenMP Analysis Report

Matrix Size: 10*10
Without OpenMP: 2.3-05es
With OpenMP: 0.0057s

Matrix Size: 100*100
Without OpenMP: 0.016s
With OpenMP: 0.014s

Matrix Size: 1000*1000
Without OpenMP: 26s
With OpenMP: 5.6s

Conclusion: 
1. When the matrix size is larger than 100*100, using OpenMP is faster.
2. Largest test matrix size is 1000*1000, the relative time is around 26s.
